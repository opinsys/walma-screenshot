# Screenshot tool for Walma Whiteboard

Walma Screenshot is a helper tool for [Walma
Whiteboard](http://walma.opinsys.fi). It acts as replacement for
gnome-screenshot in Gnome 2 environments. It replicates the functionality and
adds an option for opening the screenshot directly in Walma Whiteboard.

It currently works best in Gnome 2 environments, but should work in others too.
You just have to map Print Screen button manually.
